# FastAPI Row Security 🚣‍♂️

Row-Level Security (RLS) in SQLAlchemy for PostgreSQL with [Row Security Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html):

- Restrict access to specific rows 🔒 minimizing unauthorized data exposure.
- Perfect for Scalability and Multi-Tenancy: keep the data playground organized 🏢, ensuring each tenant plays in their own sandbox.

> **Warning**
> Understand that the [database superuser](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/role-attributes.html) bypasses all permission checks, except the right to log in. This is a dangerous privilege and should not be used in combination with RLS.

## Installation

Use pip to install from PyPI:

```cmd
pip install fastapi-rowsecurity
```

## Basic Usage

In your SQLAlchemy model, create an attribute named `__rls_policies__` that is a list of `Permissive` or `Restrictive` policies:

```py
from fastapi_rowsecurity import Permissive, register_rls
from fastapi_rowsecurity.principals import Authenticated, UserOwner

Base = declarative_base()
register_rls(Base) # <- create all policies


class Item(Base):
    __tablename__ = "items"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String, index=True)
    owner_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    owner = relationship("User", back_populates="items")


    __rls_policies__ = [
            Permissive(expr=Authenticated, cmd="SELECT"),
            Permissive(expr=UserOwner, cmd=["INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE"]),
        ]
```

The above implies that any authenticated user can read all items; but can only insert, update or delete owned items.

- `expr`: any Boolean expression as a string;
- `cmd`: any command of `ALL`/`SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`.

Next, attach the `current_user_id` (or other [runtime parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-set.html) that you need) to the user session:

```py
# ... def get_session() -> Session:
session.execute(text(f"SET app.current_user_id = {current_user_id}"))
```

Find a simple example in the ![tests](./tests/simple_model.py).

## Backlog first release

- [ ] Documentation

then ...

- [ ] Support for Alembic
- [ ] When item is tried to delete, no error is raised?
- [ ] Python 3.11

## Final note

At the moment this module is work-in-progress and therefore experimental. All feedback and ideas are 100% welcome! So feel free to contribute or reach out to me!
