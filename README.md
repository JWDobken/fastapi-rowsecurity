# FastAPI Row Security 🚣‍♂️

Row-Level Security (RLS) in SQLAlchemy with [Row Security Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html):

- Restrict access to specific rows 🔒 based on user permissions, minimizing unauthorized data exposure.
- Managing who sees what becomes a breeze 😎, without solely relying on application-level permissions.
- Perfect for Scalability and Multi-Tenancy: keep the data playground organized 🏢, ensuring each tenant plays in their own sandbox.

Can we finally start deploying on fridays? (_eh... no_)

```cmd
pip install fastapi-rowsecurity
```
